We often use CDN services, like e.g. Cloudflare to proxy traffic. 
By default, these services use some kind of cache policy which causes a lot of random issues.
To avoid these problems, you have to exclude Reposilite from cached resources, 
for instance - if you use Cloudflare - you can set `Cache Level` to `Bypass` through the custom page rules:
