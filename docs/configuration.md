There are two ways to pass custom properties to your Reposilite instance:

* Through the `reposilite.cdn` configuration file
* Using the [system properties](#system-properties) *(overrides values from configuration)*

Detailed description of properties is located in the following chapters:
* [Repositories](./repositories)
* [Authorization](./authorization)
* [Proxy](./proxy)
* [Customization](./customization)

## Default configuration
The standard configuration of Reposilite should be generated
by Reposilite during your first start and it should look like this:

```json5
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ #
#       Reposilite       #
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ #

# Hostname
# The hostname can be used to limit which connections are accepted.
# Use 0.0.0.0 to accept connections from anywhere.
# 127.0.0.1 will only allow connections from localhost.
hostname: 0.0.0.0
# Port to bind
port: 80
# Database. Supported storage providers:
# - sqlite reposilite.db
# - sqlite --temporary
# - mysql localhost:3306 database user password
database: sqlite reposilite.db

Customized version of configuration file can be found in test workspace: [reposilite.cdn](https://github.com/dzikoysk/reposilite/blob/master/reposilite-backend/src/test/workspace/reposilite.cdn)

## System properties
Passing properties through the system properties is especially useful, 
when we want to use Docker image. The parameter must be provided in the following structure:

```properties
-Dreposilite.propertyName=propertyValue
-Dreposilite.propertyName=arrayValue1,arrayValue2
```

For instance:

```bash
$ java -Xmx32M -Dreposilite.port=8080 -jar reposilite.jar
```


## Parameters
Some of the properties have to be set through the command-line parameters.

### Working directory
To declare custom working directory for Reposilite instance,
you should use `--working-directory` *(alias: `-wd`)* parameter:

```console
$ java -jar reposilite.jar --working-directory=/app/data
```

### Configuration file
You may also declare custom location of configuration file using the `--config` *(alias: `-cfg`)* parameter:

```console
$ java -jar reposilite.jar --config=/etc/reposilite/reposilite.cdn
```

You don't have to create this file manually,
Reposilite will generate it during the first startup, 
but make sure that you've granted `write` permission.

### Properties
Using the system properties, 
you can also override values from the loaded configuration.
See [configuration#system-properties](./configuration#system-properties) to learn more.

### Log file
Reposilite uses [tinylog](https://tinylog.org) as logging library. 
To change location of log file, use [system properties](https://tinylog.org/v2/configuration/#configuration):

```console
$ java -Dtinylog.writerFile.file=/etc/reposilite/log.txt -jar reposilite.jar
```
