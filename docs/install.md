You can download standalone version of Reposilite from GitHub releases page:

* [GitHub Downloads](https://github.com/dzikoysk/reposilite/releases)

You may also use Docker image available on Docker Hub:

* [DockerHub Repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/dzikoysk/reposilite)

## Requirements
* Java 8+
* RAM 12MB+

| Amount | Description |
|:------:|-------------|
| *12MB* | Tiny repository for personal projects |
| *16MB* - *32MB* | *--------------------^------------------* + CI + Proxy |
| *48MB - 128MB* | Tiny public repository *(recommended)* |
| *128MB+* | Public repository | 


## Running
To launch Reposilite with defined amount of RAM, use `-Xmx` parameter, for instance:

```console
$ java -Xmx32M -jar reposilite.jar
```

If you will not define the memory size, Reposilite will probably use around *~40MB to ~250MB*.

### Interactive CLI
Reposilite exposes interactive console directly in a terminal and it awaits for an input.
Type `help` and learn more about available commands.

**Note**: Your first access token has to be generated through the terminal or provided as a command line argument.  
Read more about tokens and token management commands here: [Authorization](authorization#generate-token).

### Structure
Reposilite stores data in current [working directory](#working-directory),
by default it is a place where you've launched it.

```shell-session
user@host ~/workspace: java -jar reposilite.jar
```

```
~workspace/
+--repositories/        The root directory for all declared repositories
   +--private/          Default private repository
   +--releases/         Default repository for releases
   +--snapshots/        Default repository for snapshot releases
+--static/              Static website content
+--log.txt              Mirror of log from CLI
+--reposilite.jar       Application file
+--reposilite.cdn       Configuration file
+--reposilite.db        Data file containing stats and tokens (only if sqlite is used as database)
```

To separate data files and configuration from application, use [parameters](configuration#parameters).

### Interface
If Reposilite has been launched properly,
you should be able to see its frontend located under the default http://localhost:80/#/ address:
