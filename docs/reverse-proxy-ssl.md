Lots of people like to use a reverse proxy like nginx with reposilite. This is a page on
how to setup Nginx with SSL.

## Step 1
First, install and setup Reposilite. Make sure to setup Reposilite to listen on port 8080 (or anything other than 80 and 443).

Then, install nginx, openssl, and certbot [using snapd*](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd/) `sudo snap install certbot --classic` and `sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot`

*[snapd is recommended by certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=other&os=ubuntufocal)

## Step 2
Next you have to generate your certificates. To do this you will need a valid domain name and have your server pointed at it. 
Run `sudo certbot certonly --standalone` and follow the instructions.
Then, run `sudo mkdir /etc/nginx/ssl` and `sudo openssl dhparam -out /etc/nginx/ssl/dhparam.pem 2048` (also make sure www-data can read the file) This will take a while.

## Step 3
Create these files (replace repo.example.com with your domain):

/etc/nginx/sites-available/reposilite-proxy.conf
```conf
# Prepare easy to use header value for websocket connections - needs to be outside server block

map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
        default upgrade;
        '' close;
}

server {

        server_name repo.example.com;

        listen 443 ssl http2;
        listen [::]:443 ssl http2;

        include /etc/nginx/custom-snippets/ssl.conf;

        location / {
                proxy_pass http://localhost:8080/;  # 8080 is the port reposilite is running on (change this to your port)
                proxy_http_version 1.1;
                proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
        }

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/repo.example.com/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/repo.example.com/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
}

# Redirect all http requests to https

server {
        listen 80 default_server;
        listen [::]:80 default_server;
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
```

/etc/nginx/custom-snippets/ssl.conf
HINT: `sudo mkdir /etc/nginx/custom-snippets` The contents of this file can also be inlined in place of the included directive, but it's handy to keep them in a separate file so that it's reusable. 
```conf
# Protocols
ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
# Ciphers
ssl_ciphers EECDH+AESGCM:EECDH+AES256;

ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;

# Diffie-Hellman key exchange with better parameters
ssl_dhparam /etc/nginx/ssl/dhparam.pem;    # Needs to be created via openssl dhparam -out /etc/nginx/ssl/dhparam.pem 2048 
ssl_ecdh_curve secp384r1;


# HTTP Strict Transport Security

add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000;includeSubdomains;";
```

## Step 4
Finally, run `sudo nginx -t` to verify the config and `sudo systemctl restart nginx` to restart nginx.
This config also works with cloudflare.
